TODO: 
Apparently, we'd better use OpenLayers https://openlayersbook.github.io/ch10-openlayers-goes-mobile/example-04.html

1. index.html: create basic HTML to show a Map
2. Node: create server-side to:
		hold a Dict of users and their current locations
		accept user's current location
		return the Dict of locations
3. index.html: create JS part to:
		send current location to server
		expect receiving the Dict of users locations
		show the Dict on the Map
			Use custom symbols: https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/symbols
4.
